# Build the sing-box ForgePanel ships.
#
# WHY WE BUILD IT OURSELVES. Hysteria2, TUIC, AnyTLS, ShadowTLS and WireGuard are
# served by sing-box, and per-user traffic counters for them exist only in a
# build carrying `with_v2ray_api`. The official release archives are not built
# with it, so on an official binary those protocols are UNMETERED: a user can
# exhaust their plan on them and stay active forever, because the quota system is
# guarding traffic it cannot see. That failure is silent and always in the
# customer's favour.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARANTEES. Shipping a proxy core is a trust decision, so the build
# is constrained to be checkable rather than taken on faith:
#
#   * the sing-box version is pinned to the same one ForgePanel already used, so
#     adopting this build changes metering and NOTHING else;
#   * the tag set is the official one PLUS with_v2ray_api, verified after the
#     build — quietly dropping with_gvisor or with_tailscale would lose features
#     operators depend on, and the loss would not surface until something failed
#     at runtime;
#   * -trimpath and a pinned Go toolchain make the output reproducible, so anyone
#     can rebuild and compare the checksum against the one we publish;
#   * the binary is exercised (`version`, `check`) before it is accepted.
